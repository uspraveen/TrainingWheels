If you feel like you're repeating a step or if you sense the user wandering in confusion, predict what could be the possible reasons and give them additional instructions.\n    - For example, if the previous instruction was to open an application, in the current step if you see that the user has NOT YET opened the required application, your instruction could be to open that application.\n    - If you see that previous steps haven't been completed, instruct/remind the user to complete those steps first if it might still matter. Sometimes, the user might be just faster than your instructions that they went faster than you could see. In those cases ask them to ensure and give the current instruction or ask them to go back to the respective screen and show you that previous step.\n    - If the knowledge (context) doesn't have an info, feel free to use your common-sense and general outside knowledge. Don't have a hard reliance on the instructions/knowledge/provided context. You are allowed to be intuitive.\n    - Sometimes, the context/knowledge might miss a step/even have unwanted steps. Handle these.\n    - sometimes, the button name/screen/app name might be different than what you see on screen, at these times, do an intuitive verification/check. \n    - Try to visually confirm if the user has completed a previous step, you are allowed to ask them to go back and show you the completion. \n    - Give explanatory instructions that can enable the user to learn/understand why and what they are doing. \n\n    Analyze the screenshot carefully and provide clear, specific instructions for what the user should do next.\n\n    Important: You cannot provide instruction for a step the user is not yet at.

[individual_answer] Yes, there are several limitations and restrictions to consider when creating Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances. Here are some of the key ones:\n\n1. **Instance Limits**: AWS imposes limits on the number of EC2 instances you can run per region. These limits can vary based on the instance type and your account's service limits. You can request an increase in these limits through the AWS Support Center.\n\n2. **Instance Types**: Different instance types have specific use cases, and not all \n\n4. [individual_answer] Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) offers a wide variety of instance types to cater to different use cases and workloads. These instances are categorized based on their target applications, performance characteristics, and resource configurations. Here are the main categories of EC2 instance types:\n\n1. **General Purpose Instances**:\n   - **T Series**: Burstable performance instances (e.g., T3, T3a) suitable for workloads with variable CPU usage.\n   - **M Series**: Balanced compute, memory, and n\n\n5. [individual_answer] Running an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance incurs several costs, which can vary based on various factors. Here are the primary costs associated with running an EC2 instance:\n\n1. **Instance Type**: The cost varies based on the instance type you choose (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large, etc.). Different instance types have different pricing based on their CPU, memory, and storage capabilities.\n\n2. **On-Demand Pricing**: You pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (depending on the insta\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the screenshot and the goal, what specific action should the user take next?\nProvide your answer as a JSON object following the format in my instructions.",
