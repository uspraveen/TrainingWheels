      "query": "What are the steps to launch a free AWS EC2 instance?",
      "content": "To successfully launch a free AWS EC2 instance, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.\n\n2. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, check the current AWS Region and select a Region that is closer to you if desired.\n\n3. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance pane, choose Launch instance.\n\n4. Under Name and tags, enter a descriptive name for your instance.\n\n5. Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image):\n   a. Choose Quick Start, and then select the operating system (OS) for your instance (for your first Linux instance, choose Amazon Linux).\n   b. Select an AMI that is marked Free Tier eligible.\n\n6. Under Instance type, choose t2.micro (or t3.micro if t2.micro is not available), which is eligible for the Free Tier.\n\n7. Under Key pair (login), choose an existing key pair or create a new key pair.\n\n8. Under Network settings, use the default VPC and subnet, and configure a security group that allows connections to your instance from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). (Note: This is not recommended for production environments.)\n\n9. Under Configure storage, notice that a root volume is configured, which is sufficient for test purposes.\n\n10. Review the summary of your instance configuration in the Summary panel, and when ready, choose Launch instance.\n\n11. If the launch is successful, choose the ID of the instance from the Success notification to open the Instances page and monitor the status of the launch.\n\n12. Select the checkbox for the instance. The initial instance state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running. Choose the Status and alarms tab. After your instance passes its status checks, it is ready to receive connection requests.",
