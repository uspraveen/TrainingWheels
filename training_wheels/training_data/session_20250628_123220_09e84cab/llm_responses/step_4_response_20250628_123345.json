If you feel like you're repeating a step or if you sense the user wandering in confusion, predict what could be the possible reasons and give them additional instructions.\n    - For example, if the previous instruction was to open an application, in the current step if you see that the user has NOT YET opened the required application, your instruction could be to open that application.\n    - If you see that previous steps haven't been completed, instruct/remind the user to complete those steps first if it might still matter. Sometimes, the user might be just faster than your instructions that they went faster than you could see. In those cases ask them to ensure and give the current instruction or ask them to go back to the respective screen and show you that previous step.\n    - If the knowledge (context) doesn't have an info, feel free to use your common-sense and general outside knowledge. Don't have a hard reliance on the instructions/knowledge/provided context. You are allowed to be intuitive.\n    - Sometimes, the context/knowledge might miss a step/even have unwanted steps. Handle these.\n    - sometimes, the button name/screen/app name might be different than what you see on screen, at these times, do an intuitive verification/check. \n    - Try to visually confirm if the user has completed a previous step, you are allowed to ask them to go back and show you the completion. \n    - Give explanatory instructions that can enable the user to learn/understand why and what they are doing. \n\n    Analyze the screenshot carefully and provide clear, specific instructions for what the user should do next.\n\n    Important: You cannot provide instruction for a step the user is not yet at.

[consolidated_answer] To create an AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance, follow these comprehensive steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Launch an EC2 Instance\n\n1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console**\n   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your AWS account credentials.\n\n2. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard**\n   - Click on \"Services\" and select \"EC2\" under the \"Compute\" section.\n\n3. **Launch an Instance**\n   - Click on the \"Launch Instance\" button in the EC2 Dashboard.\n\n4.\n\n2. [individual_answer] Certainly! Setting up an AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console\n1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).\n2. Sign in with your AWS account credentials.\n\n### Step 2: Navigate to EC2 Dashboard\n1. In the AWS Management Console, find the \"Services\" menu at the top.\n2. Click on \"EC2\" under the \"Compute\" section.\n\n### Step 3: Launch an In\n\n3. [individual_answer] Yes, there are several limitations and restrictions to consider when launching an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance on AWS. Here are some of the key ones:\n\n1. **Instance Limits**: AWS imposes limits on the number of EC2 instances you can run per region. These limits can vary based on the instance type and your account's service limits. You can request an increase in these limits through the AWS Support Center.\n\n2. **Instance Types**: Not all instance types are available in every region\n\n4. [individual_answer] Running an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance on AWS involves several costs that can vary based on various factors. Here are the primary cost components associated with running an EC2 instance:\n\n1. **Instance Type**: The cost of the instance depends on the type you choose (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large, c5.xlarge). Different instance types have different pricing based on their CPU, memory, and storage capabilities.\n\n2. **Pricing Model**:\n   - **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity\n\n5. [individual_answer] Creating and managing AWS EC2 instances effectively involves following best practices that ensure security, performance, cost-efficiency, and maintainability. Here are some key best practices:\n\n### 1. **Instance Selection**\n   - **Choose the Right Instance Type**: Select an instance type that matches your workload requirements (compute, memory, storage, or GPU optimized).\n   - **Use Spot Instances**: For non-critical workloads, consider using Spot Instances to save costs.\n\n### 2. **Security Best\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the screenshot and the goal, what specific action should the user take next?\nProvide your answer as a JSON object following the format in my instructions.",
