In the navigation bar, select the AWS Region you want to use.\n3. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance pane, choose Launch instance.\n4. Under Name and tags, enter a descriptive name for your instance.\n5. Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image):\n   a. Choose Quick Start, and then select the operating system (OS) for your instance. For your first Linux instance, it is recommended to choose Amazon Linux.\n   b. Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is marked Free Tier eligible.\n6. Under Instance type, choose t2.micro, which is eligible for the Free Tier. If t2.micro is not available in your region, t3.micro is also eligible for the Free Tier.\n7. Under Key pair (login), choose an existing key pair or create a new key pair.\n8. Under Network settings, use the default VPC and subnet, and configure a security group that allows connections to your instance from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).\n9. Under Configure storage, note that a root volume is configured, which is sufficient for test purposes.\n10. Review the summary of your instance configuration and choose Launch instance.\n11. If the launch is successful, choose the ID of the instance from the Success notification to monitor the status of the launch.\n12. Select the checkbox for the instance and wait for its state to change from pending to running.\n\nAfter your instance passes its status checks, it is ready to receive connection requests.",

      "content": "To launch a free EC2 instance on AWS, follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.\n\n2. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, check the current AWS Region. You can use the selected Region or choose a closer one.\n\n3. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance pane, choose Launch instance.\n\n4. Under Name and tags, for Name, enter a descriptive name for your instance.\n\n5. Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), do the following:\n   a. Choose Quick Start, and then select the operating system (OS) for your instance. For your first Linux instance, it is recommended to choose Amazon Linux.\n   b. From Amazon Machine Image (AMI), select an AMI that is marked Free Tier eligible.\n\n6. Under Instance type, for Instance type, choose t2.micro, which is eligible for the Free Tier. If t2.micro is not available in your Region, t3.micro is also eligible for the Free Tier.\n\n7. Under Key pair (login), for Key pair name, choose an existing key pair or create a new key pair to create your first key pair.\n   > Warning: If you choose Proceed without a key pair (Not recommended), you won't be able to connect to your instance.\n\n8. Under Network settings, notice that the default VPC is selected, along with the default subnet in an Availability Zone and a security group that allows connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).\n   > Warning: Specifying 0.0.0.0/0 enables traffic from any IP address, which is acceptable for a test environment but unsafe for production. In production, restrict access to specific IP addresses.\n\n   For your first instance, it is recommended to use the default settings. You can update your network settings as follows:\n   - (Optional) To use a specific default subnet, choose Edit and then select a subnet.\n   - (Optional) To use a different VPC, choose Edit and select an existing VPC. Ensure the VPC is configured for public internet access.\n   - (Optional) To restrict inbound connection traffic, choose Custom instead of Anywhere and enter the CIDR block for your network.\n   - (Optional) To use a different security group, choose Select existing security group and select an existing security group. Ensure it allows connection traffic from your network.\n\n9. Under Configure storage, notice that a root volume is configured but no data volumes. This is sufficient for test purposes.\n\n10. Review a summary of your instance configuration in the Summary panel, and when you're ready, choose Launch instance.\n\n11. If the launch is successful, choose the ID of the instance from the Success notification to open the Instances page and monitor the status of the launch.\n\n12. Select the checkbox for the instance. The initial instance state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running. Choose the Status and alarms tab. After your instance passes its status checks, it is ready to receive connection requests.",
